# What is MVVM Clean architecture ?

The most popular mobile architectural pattern is the Model View View-Model Clean Architecture or also called as MVVM Clean.




The Model-View-ViewModel pattern (MVVM) provides a clear separation of concerns between the user-interface and Domain.
When used together with Clean Architecture it can help to separate concerns between Presentation and UI Layers.
